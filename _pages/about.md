# Welcome! 
I am currently a master's student at [The University of ShangHaiTech](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/). Fortunately to be supervised  by [Prof. Xuming He](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/hexm/index.html) in the Plus Lab, part of The Visual & Data Intelligence (VDI) Center.

Since September 2024, I have been working as an intern at [Tencent - Robotics X](https://roboticsx.tencent.com/) as a daily intern in Shenzhen, focusing on robotic grasping based on human priors. At [AGI-bot](https://www.agibot.com/), I work on world models and video generation models. I believe that a model that understands physical constraints and world rules is an important cornerstone on the road to AGI.

My research interests include Deep Learning, Generative Models, and Embodied AI.

You can find my CV here: [wuxiaofei](../assets/resume.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](wuxiaofei01@qq.com).
